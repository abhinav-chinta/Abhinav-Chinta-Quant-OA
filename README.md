# Quant Assessments

## For applicants
Please fork this repository and clone the specific branch we have specified for your assessment to start working. The prompt will be contained within. Once you have finished, we will have a way for you to submit your work (most likely google form) where you can send us your git repo. 

## For contributors
Please make sure to work on a new branch. Each new branch will be for a different assessment and name them accordingly, starting with the tech stack and then the implementation details.

Make a new folder (with the same name as the branch) and put all relevant files in the folder. Checkout the template for an outline of what it should look like.
